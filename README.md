This project is a part of the Digital Assessment for **BCSE206L â€“ Foundations of Data Science**. It provides forecasting and visualization of Earth's surface temperature using three models: **ARIMA**, **LSTM**, and a **Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM** model, integrated into an interactive **Dash dashboard**.




## Features

- Time-series forecasting using:
  - ARIMA
  - LSTM
  - ARIMA-LSTM Hybrid
-  Interactive geospatial dashboard (with `plotly`)
-  Comparison of actual vs predicted temperatures
-  Insight into climate trends and predictions
